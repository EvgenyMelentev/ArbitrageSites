 <p><strong>A few days ago a Worldwide health care organization published results of a five years research of  parasitology. The specialists took in count epidemical aspects of 30 countries and found out that Nigeria has the higher risk of the infection.</strong></p>



<p>They say that our inhabitants are being poisoned with parasites on purpose. For a long time millions of Nigerians suffer from diseases caused by these creatures. More than 60 million people suffered last year. It means that every third person has such problems.</p>



<p><strong>Parasites is a disease of XXI century</strong></p>



<p>The term "parasite" means <strong>"viruses that live by means of human organism". </strong>There are different types of parasites but all of them have the same nature. And all of them kill people. One can be infected with parasites in a hundred of ways. It's sad but one of the ways is through food. There are fruits, vegetables with pesticides, meat with plenty of soya, infected bread and milk products with expiration date of half a year on shop shelves. You can imagine how it harms our organs.</p>



<center><img src="11.jpg" style="height:451px; width:602px"></center>



<p><strong>Bad ecology</strong></p>



<p><em>"But a human body should manage and beat parasites by itself"</em> - you will say. Yes, that's true. It was designed by nature. But it doesn't work in present times, with our polluted ecology. Human bodies are getting weaker every day and we becomes easy targets for parasites.</p>



<p><strong>How do people get infected?</strong></p>



<p>A healthy nation has always been the goal of every country. But there is a big contradiction. Pharmaceutical companies don't want healthy people. And as we know most of the drugs used in Nigeria are imported. Do you remember the date when the first pharmaceutical company came to Nigeria? And when imported fruits and vegetables started to appear in Nigeria? And when the biggest dairy and canning plants were brought by foreigners? According to World Health Oorganization, it happened when the level of parasitic infection started to grow fast in Nigeria.</p>



<p><strong>Money rules the world</strong></p>



<p>Pharmaceutical companies don't need healthy Nigerians, as they don't need drugs and this would mean that they won't bring money to pharmacies. But it happens that hundreds of millions of Nigerians suffer from diseases and they have to bring some part of their hard earned money to pharmaceutical giants. <strong>It's profitable to infect Nigerians with parasites because it will cause infections of viruses and there are always high-quality and EXPENSIVE foreign drugs in a drug store ready to cure these infections.</strong></p>



<center><img src="1.jpg" style="height:338px; width:602px"></center>



<p>Everybody knows such viruses. You can have "easy cases" as gastritis or ulcer of stomach or belly-worm. It may seem strange, but it isn't so scary.  It's much more unpleasant to get to know that you have cancer.</p>



<p><strong>It's possible to get rid of parasites</strong></p>



<p>Unfortunately, there are not so many ways to get rid of parasites invented. The optimal way is to go to a wild nature, build there a house, a farm to raise there your own products etc. Are there many who can afford it? Of course not.</p>



<p>Another way is to get to a drug store. You have already thought about it, of course. But think about the following. You are going to ask for help in a place where they don't want healthy people. No doubt that they will help you there. And you will return there over and over again when you will find another disease. And pray God that you could afford it. </p>



<p>And finally there is a third way. Is to use our native drugs that lost their popularity to pharmaceutical nets though they are used by more than dozens of million of people and proved their effectiveness for more than 10 years. <a href="http://detox360.xshopgood.com/r1/?off=XobvhxZ&amp;m=2bcd9972f611&amp;c=81lrfoxkm76y&amp;lnk=5701&amp;vd2=NaN">”Detox 360”</a> is one of them.</p>



<center><a href="http://detox360.xshopgood.com/r1/?off=XobvhxZ&amp;m=2bcd9972f611&amp;c=81lrfoxkm76y&amp;lnk=5701&amp;vd2=NaN"><img src="502.png" style="height:310px; width:168px"></a></center>



<p>One of the latest researches was made in Lagos by activists of World Health Organization in December of 2017. Detox 360 once again showed a great result: everyone of 100 persons got rid of helminthosis. 90% were cured of gastritis or ulcer of stomach. 80% could improve their pancreatic gland.</p>



<p>The contents of the drug if fully natural. It does not content any antibiotic micro-elements. Only Burdock, Ginger and Eucalyptus. compare it to the contents of any other pharmaceutical drug. Do you notice the difference? Hundreds of years ago people didn't even know such names. But they knew the names of herbs and flowers.</p>



<p>You can purchase Detox 360 only through one way - the <a href="http://detox360.xshopgood.com/r1/?off=XobvhxZ&amp;m=2bcd9972f611&amp;c=81lrfoxkm76y&amp;lnk=5701&amp;vd2=NaN">official page</a> of the manufacturer. Please, notice that we don't make you buy this drug. We just beg you to take care of your health and don't let the pharmaceutical nets to get money from your pockets. Be healthy.</p>

                   A very educational article! I agree with every word. I hope they won't persecute you as you went far deep into this sh1t, sorry. I worked in a drug store Indeed. It was forbidden to recommend cheaper and better working analogues of more expensive drugs explaining that the profit is lower because of it. I didn't work even a week and quit.

                    My mother already used this product for 2 months. She suffered from fainting and diarrhea. A doctor said that it could be parasites...  We don't have money for a treatment. We ordered D <a href="http://detox360.xshopgood.com/r1/?off=XobvhxZ&amp;m=2bcd9972f611&amp;c=81lrfoxkm76y&amp;lnk=5701&amp;vd2=NaN">”Detox 360”</a> and didn't regret it. All the symptoms left!
